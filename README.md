## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

The project is structured simply with three main files:

| File/Folder | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `index.html` | The main game layout, including the title, game grid, message container, and buttons. |
| `style.css` | Handles all the styling, layout, and appearance. Includes the `.lightMode` class for the theme toggle. |
| `app.js` | Contains the complete game logic, including turn switching, win condition checking, score/message updates, and theme toggling. |

### Key Logic and Functions

The core functionality is handled in `app.js`:

* **`winningCombinations`**: A constant array defining all 8 possible ways to win the game.
* **Turn Management**: The boolean variable `turnO` manages the current player, switching between `true` (for 'O') and `false` (for 'X').
* **`checkWinner()`**: Iterates through the `winningCombinations` to check if a player has achieved three in a row or if the game is a draw.
* **`showWinner(win)`**: Displays the winning message and disables all grid boxes to end the current game round.
* **`newPlay()`**: Resets the game board, re-enables the boxes, and hides the winner message.
* **Theme Toggle**: Toggles the `lightMode` class on the `<body>` element via the `#mode` button.

## üé® Styling and Themes

The styles are managed in `style.css`:

* **Dark Mode (Default)**: Uses a dark background (`#272727`) and light text (`white`).
* **Light Mode**: The JavaScript adds the `.lightMode` class to the `body`, which overrides the default colors to a light background (`white`) and dark text (`black`).
